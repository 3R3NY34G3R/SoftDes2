        <h2> POTHOS (Epipremnum aureum) </h2>
        <p> One of the easiest houseplants to grow. This tropical vine comes in a variety of foliage colors and patterns. Pothos can be trimmed and kept compact, allowed to trail from hanging baskets, or trained up vertical supports.</p>

        <p><strong>Size:</strong> Vines 6 to 10 feet long
        <br><strong>Water:</strong>Allow the top inch of soil to dry out between watering.
        <br><strong>Fertilize:</strong>Light feeders, so use a balanced liquid fertilizer every 1 to 3 months.</p>
        
        <h2> PHILODENDRON (Philodendron spp.) </h2>
        <p>Another very easy-to-grow houseplant, similar to pothos. Tolerates low light, but will grow faster in medium to bright light. Foliage comes in a variety of sizes, shapes, and colors. Philodendrons can also be grown outdoors in mild climates.</p>
